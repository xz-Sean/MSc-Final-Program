# Deliverables

Commit your written reports to this directory using the exact filenames specified below:

| Deliverable     | Filename                          |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| Project Plan    | `xz2821-project-plan.pdf`     |
| Final Report    | `xz2821-final-report.pdf`     |

**Filenames must:**
- Be all lowercase  
- Use dashes (`-`) instead of underscores (`_`)  
- Have a `.pdf` extension  
- Contain no whitespace

## Validating with GitHub Actions

To verify your submission is readable, ensure the corresponding GitHub Actions workflow (`project-plan` or `final-report`) passes.

It is normal for the workflows to fail until you have submitted the required deliverables. The checks will only pass once your reports are correctly named, below the maximum file size limit, and committed before the deadline.
